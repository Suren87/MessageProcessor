I haven’t mentioned my experience with Apache wicket in my CV as many companies don’t have much Idea about the Wicket. Let me give a quick overview of my experience with Wicket.
Apache Wicket is a neat web framework to create web sites and web applications. I’ve worked with Wicket extensively for more than 3 years, both at work and for my private project. 
I really like the framework. Properly used it can greatly improve productivity building web-based user interfaces. Used the wrong way it can lead to, well, a great code mess, bloated session sizes, serialization errors, bad performance, side effects and a poor user experience.
Where Wicket really shines is, when it comes to dynamic rendering of User Interfaces. For example based on meta data or an abstract meta model like we do it in the Dynamic Application Framework. I ‘ve build my set of components that do exactly what I want and I like to reuse them all over the place Also, I’ve build new components and improved the existing ones. I don’t want to go into too much detail here. Please let me know if you want me explain more about my wicket experience.
